# Linear Search üìö

Let‚Äôs say we were asked the question: does the list below contain the number `14`? Without thinking twice, most of us would scan down through the list until we arrive at the number `14`. 

This intuitive response is called a **linear search**.

As we scan each element we perform a quick Boolean calculation ``True`` or ``False`` - is the element I am looking at equal to `14`? 

If the result is _True_, we have found the required element and the search can end; otherwise, if the result is _False_ we automatically (and very quickly) move on to the next element and repeat the Boolean calculation. 

This process continues until either we find `14`, or we reach the end of the list, by which time we can conclude that the `14` is not contained in the list.

The linear search algorithm is also called a _sequential search_. The sequential nature of the process is illustrated below.

### Flowchart 
Given a list of elements to search through (i.e. keys), and a target value to search for (i.e. an argument), the steps of the _linear (sequential) search_ algorithm can be expressed as follows:

1. Set a marker at the start of the list (called ``idx`` in the flowchart below)
2. Loop through steps 3‚àí7 as long as there are more numbers to compare
3. Compare the current element to the target value
4.  If they match:
5. Return the value of the marker (``idx``)
6. If they are not equal:
7. Advance the marker right by one position (``idx = idx + 1``)
8. Return the value of the marker (``idx``)

When the above algorithm is applied to find the number fourteen in the list show below it will result in a value of 5. This is the index position of the target element in the list. 

üí°**Note:** _Recall, that a list index is a zero-based positional offset. (the 1st item is at index `0`)_

In the example above, when the target value is not found in the list, the algorithm returns the length of the list. 

For example, if the algorithm was applied to find the number ``22`` in the above list the result will be ``8`` _(because the length of this list is 8)._

### Advantages and disadvantages of the Linear Search algorithms: üìù

**Advantages**
1. Simplicity - The linear search is intuitive to most. It is relatively easy to understand and implement.
2. It does not require the data to be stored in any particular order.
 
**Disadvantage**

1. The main disadvantage of the linear search algorithm lies in its _**lack of efficiency.**_
   
The more elements there are in a list the greater the amount of time it will take to search for any specific element. 

In fact, the amount of time it takes to find a target value increases in proportion to the number of elements in the list to search. Therefore, it will take **ten times longer** to find an element in a list of **1,000 elements** than it would for a list of **100 elements**. 

This is called _**linear time complexity**_, or **``O(n)``** for short.


## Challenge ‚öîÔ∏è
Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in a list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.

In linear search, we iterate through each element of the list until we find the target element or reach the end of the list. 

It has a time complexity of ``O(n)``, where ``n`` is the number of elements in the list.

### Part A
Create a function `def linear_search () ` that will find the target number shown in the sample code below:

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7
````

### Part B
Return a display to the console confirming if the target number has been found in the list.

````python
print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}.")
````

### Part C
Change the value of `target` so it is not an element of the list.

Now, edit your program to return a display to the console confirming the target number has **not** been found in the list.

````python
print(f"Element {target} not found in the list.")
````
