# Linear & Binary Search ðŸ“š

## Linear Search
Letâ€™s say we were asked the question: does the list below contain the number `14`? Without thinking twice, most of us would scan down through the list until we arrive at the number `14`. 

This intuitive response is called a linear search.

As we scan each element we perform a quick Boolean calculation. 

``True`` or ``False`` - is the element I am looking at equal to `14`? If the result is _True_, we have found the required element and the search can end; otherwise, if the result is _False_ we automatically (and very quickly) move on to the next element and repeat the Boolean calculation. 

This process continues until either we find `14`, or we reach the end of the list, by which time we can conclude that the `14` is not contained in the list.

The linear search algorithm is also called a _sequential search_. The sequential nature of the process is illustrated below.
