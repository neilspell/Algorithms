# Binary Search üìö
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm however it does require the list to be sorted first. 
- It repeatedly divides the search interval in **half** until the target element is found.

The binary search algorithm is an example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm.
- Divide-and-conquer is problem solving technique which works by repeatedly reducing the problem _(divide)_ and then attempting to solve the problem _(conquer)_ on the new problem space.
- In this case the approach is to repeatedly divide the portion of the list that could contain the item in two _(i.e. half)_, until either the item is found or the list cannot be divided any further.

In computer science, **Binary Search**, also known as _half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop,_ is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a **sorted list _(array)_**. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.

- Instead of testing the list's first element, the binary search starts with the element in the middle.
- If that element happens to contain the target value, then the search is over.
- If the target value is less than the middle element of the list, we restrict the search to the first half of the list; otherwise we search the second half of the list.
- Either way, half of the list‚Äôs elements are eliminated from further searching on each iteration and the procedure is repeated for the half of the list that potentially contains the value.

This process continues until the value being searched for is either found, or there are no more elements to test.



### Pseudo-Code üìù
The pseudo-code for the binary search algorithm is as follows:
````
1. Set low = 0
2. Set high = length of list ‚Äì 1
3. Set mid = (low+high)//2, rounded down to an integer
4.  If the value at the mid position is the same as the target value
      Return mid
    Else If the value at the mid position is less than the target value
      Set low = mid + 1
    Else If the value at the mid position is greater than the target value
      Set high = mid - 1
5. As long as low doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòcross over‚Äô high, go back to step 3 above 6. Return -1
````
Let‚Äôs say we were tasked with applying the above algorithm to search for a target value of **``28``** in the following list of 16 values. 

üí°**Note:** The index numbers from 0‚Ä¶15 are displayed over each list element and, crucially, that **the list has already been sorted.**

- In the first three steps of the algorithm we set the variables ``low = 0``, ``high = 15`` and ``mid = 7``.

- We now move to _line 4_ of the algorithm and since ``14`` is less than ``28`` we change the value of ``low`` to ``mid+1`` which is ``8``. 

- The value of ``mid`` is **now** computed to be ``mid = (8+15)/2`` which is ``11`` **(rounded down)**.
- Our state now look like this:

![image](https://github.com/ross-bish/Algorithms/assets/83789503/0ab92e37-b6a4-47e7-94b3-88169fca50bc)

- Since ``25`` is less than ``28`` we change the value of ``low`` again to ``mid+1``, this time to ``12``.
- The new value for ``mid`` is computed to be ``mid = (12+15)/2`` which is ``13`` **(rounded down)** and the state can be visualised as follows:

Since the next comparison finds the target value, the algorithm can terminate successfully. üòé

### Trace Tables 
The use of _trace tables_ can be very helpful in carrying out a binary search. 

A trace table for this example might look as follows:

### Unplugged Exercise üîå
Given the list, ``L`` of sixteen integers shown below:

Describe the binary search path to search ``L`` for the following target values, ``v``.

a) 19

b) 12

c) 15

A trace table with the initial values of low, mid and high already filled in is provided to get you started.

## Advantages and disadvantages of the Binary Search algorithms: üìù
**Advantage**

The binary search is much a more efficient algorithm than the linear search. Every time it makes a comparison and fails to find the desired item, it eliminates **half** of the remaining portion of the array that must be searched. 

For example, consider an array with 1,000 elements:

- If the binary search fails to find an item on the first attempt, the number of elements that remains to be searched is 500.
- If the item is not found on the second attempt, the number of elements that remains to be searched is 250.
- This process continues until the binary search has either located the desired item or determined that it is not in the array.
- With 1,000 elements this takes no more than 10 comparisons.

Compare this to the performance of the **linear search** which for this scenario would need to make an _average number of 500_, and a _worst case of 1,000 comparisons_ to achieve the same result.

#### Performance Chart üìà
The following charts illustrate how the two search algorithms stack up against each other in terms of performance.

We are already aware that the performance of the linear search increases in proportion to the number of items in the list to search. This linearity is clearly shown by the blue line below. However, notice how the performance cost of the binary search (shown by the brown line) barely rises above the x-axis using this scale.

![image](https://github.com/ross-bish/Algorithms/assets/83789503/487203e9-a2f0-45bd-864b-d029563f2a9a)

The next graph shows the same data but this time the x-axis is scaled logarithmically. Again the rise in cost of the binary search is barely noticeable as the size of the list grows. Notice, however that the cost of the linear search appears to grow exponentially with respect to the size of the list to search.

![image](https://github.com/ross-bish/Algorithms/assets/83789503/734f9beb-88a4-45f7-9941-e21b2c1c8ada)

The final graphs shown below uses a log-log scale i.e. both x- and y-axes are scaled logarithmically.

![image](https://github.com/ross-bish/Algorithms/assets/83789503/8f7f2f5c-7398-47f3-a14c-d61f573d3b8e)

Here we can finally see the true logarithmic nature of the efficiency of the binary search emerge. In particular, notice that the performance of the binary search is a logarithmic function of the size of the problem space. Furthermore, the graph is evidence that binary search is **exponentially faster than its linear counterpart.**


As can be seen from the table below the maximum number of comparisons _(steps)_ the binary search algorithm needs to perform in order to find some target value just **increases by one** each time the size of the input list is **doubled**.

**Disadvantage**

The main drawback of the binary search is that the elements must be **sorted** beforehand.

## Challenge ‚öîÔ∏è
In binary search, we divide the search interval in half at each step, which makes it more efficient.

However, binary search requires the list to be **sorted** beforehand. 

It has a time complexity of ``O(log‚ÇÇn)``, where ``n`` is the number of elements in the list.


### Part A
Create a function `def binary_search () ` that will find the target number shown in the sample code below:

````python
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
target = 7
````
### Part B
Return a display to the console confirming if the target number has been found in the list.

````python
print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}.")
````

### Part C
Change the value of `target` so it is not an element of the list.

Now, edit your program to return a display to the console confirming the target number has **not** been found in the list.

````python
print(f"Element {target} not found in the list.")
````
