# Introduction to Algorithmic Efficiency (Complexity) ðŸ“š 

Now that we have developed an understanding of how some search/sort algorithms work, the next logical step is to examine just how well they work. 

In this section we will analyse the performance of algorithms. In computer science this is often referred to as algorithmic efficiency or complexity.


Two common measures of algorithmic efficiency are space and time.

**1. Space:** Provides an indication of the demands an algorithm places on memory in terms of space requirements.

**2. Time:**  Provides an indication of the time requirements of an algorithm.

For the most part, we will be confining the remainder of our discussion to time complexity.
