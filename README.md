# Algorithms - Searching & Sorting

Algorithms are all around us. They have evolved to shape the way we live our daily lives, the way we think, and perhaps most significantly, who we are. 

But what exactly is an algorithm?


> _**An algorithm is a set of rules for getting a specific output from a specific input.
Each step must be so precisely defined that it can be translated into computer language and executed by a machine.**_ - Donald Knuth (1977)

It is difficult to think of any aspect of modern society that remains untouched by algorithms – application areas include: 

_Arts, entertainment, education, banking, finance, insurance, healthcare, medicine, media, social media, travel, tourism, crime, justice, transport, politics, public services, communications, retail, security, manufacturing, military and much, much, more._ 

_Sales, marketing, sports, games, astronomy, exploration, science and technology, construction, engineering, agriculture, food, research and development._

The list is endless!

There are algorithms to recommend our next purchases, the next book to read, the next song to listen to, the next YouTube video to watch – algorithms to maintain playlists, find the perfect partner, schedule our busy lives, pay for and deliver our shopping and so on ad infinitum.

The ubiquitous nature of algorithms and their influence on modern life should be patently clear. And for this reason alone the benefits of having a general understanding of the way they operate should also be clear. Simply put, life can be made easier when one has some level of understanding about the algorithms that are used to drive and support it.
