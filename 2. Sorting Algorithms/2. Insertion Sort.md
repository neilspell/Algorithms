# Insertion Sort ðŸ“š

Insertion sort is a basic sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. 

It iterates over the input list, removing one element per iteration and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.

Here's how insertion sort works:

1. **Start:** Begin with the second element of the list (assuming the first element is already sorted).
2. **Insertion:** Iterate over the unsorted part of the list, removing one element per iteration and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part of the list.
3. **Repeat:** Repeat step 2 until the entire list is sorted.
