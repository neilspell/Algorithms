As its name suggests, **Quicksort**, is a very efficient sorting algorithm _(considered to be the fastest general purpose sorting algorithm)._ 

Quicksort belongs to a special class of algorithms called _divide-and-conquer_ algorithms and owes much of its efficiency to divide-and-conquer as a general problem solving technique. 

- We have already seen how _**binary search**_ uses the divide-and-conquer technique to search for some arbitrary value in a list of keys.)
- _**Merge sort**_ is another popular example of a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
