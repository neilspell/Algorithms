# Bubble Sort 📚 
The bubble sort algorithm works by repeatedly comparing _**adjacent**_ elements and swapping them if they are out of order. 

The effect is that on each pass of the bubble sort, the largest unsorted item **‘bubbles’** towards the end of the list into its sorted position.

The algorithm is summarised below for an ascending order sort:
1. Initialise an unsorted list.
2. Traverse across every element in the list.
3. Compare all adjacent elements starting from the beginning.
4. If the elements are out of order, then swap them.

### Example 📝
Let’s look at how the bubble sort algorithm sorts the list of numbers shown here into ascending order.

Notice that **5 passes over** the list were required in order to sort the **5 items**. In general, the bubble sort will take ``𝑛`` passes to sort a list of ``𝑛`` items.

We now examine what happens in pass 1 in greater detail. 

The following illustrations depict the exchanges that take place in _pass 1_, and in particular, explain how ``7`` bubbles to the end of the list.

### Example 1 - Bubble Sort in Python 👨🏽‍💻

````python
# --------------
# Bubble Sort
# --------------

def bubble_sort(myList):
    # Traverse through all elements in the list
    for i in range(len(myList)):
        # Traverse through all elements except the last one
        for j in range(len(myList)-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if myList[j] > myList[j+1]:
                # Swap the elements
                myList[j], myList[j+1] = myList[j+1], myList[j]

# Example usage:
numbers = [5, 7, 3, 6, 2]
bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", numbers)
````

### Explanation 📝 
Let's break down the sample code step by step:

1. **Function Definition** `def bubble_sort(myList):`
   - This line defines a function named `bubble_sort` that takes one parameter, `myList`, which is the list to be sorted.

2. **Calculate the Length of the List** `n = len(myList)`:
   - This line calculates the length of the input list `myList` and assigns it to the variable `n`. This value will be used to determine the number of iterations needed for the outer loop.

3. **Outer Loop** `for i in range(n):`
   - This loop iterates over the list `myList` for a total of `n` times, where `n` is the length of the list.
   - Each iteration of the outer loop represents a single pass through the list to place the largest unsorted element in its correct position.

4. **Inner Loop** `for j in range(len(myList)-1):`
   - This loop iterates over all elements of the list except the last one.
   - It compares adjacent elements in the list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This loop effectively _**"bubbles up"**_ the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the list.

5. **Comparison and Swap** `if myList[j] > myList[j+1]:` and `myList[j], myList[j+1] = myList[j+1], myList[j]`:
   - Inside the inner loop, we compare each element `myList[j]` with its adjacent element `myList[j+1]`.
   - If `myList[j]` is greater than `myList[j+1]`, indicating that they are in the wrong order, we swap their positions. This places the _**larger**_ element `myList[j]` after the _**smaller**_ one `myList[j+1]`.

6. **Example Usage**:
   - We create a list of numbers `numbers = []` that we want to sort.
   - We call the `bubble_sort` function and pass the list `numbers` as an argument. This sorts the list in place.
   - Finally, we print the sorted array using `print("Sorted array:", numbers)`.
