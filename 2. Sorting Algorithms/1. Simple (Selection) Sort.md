# Simple (Selection) Sort üìö

Simple (Selection) Sort is a basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the _unsorted portion_ of the list and moves it to its correct position in the _sorted portion._

Here's how the simple sort algorithm works:

1. **Selection:** Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list.
2. **Swap:** Swap the smallest element with the first element of the unsorted portion.
3. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the remaining unsorted portion of the list.
   
Let's break it down with a simple example:

Suppose we have the unsorted list: ``myList = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]``

**First Pass:**
- Find the smallest element in the entire list, which is 11.
- Swap 11 with the first element (64).
- List becomes: [11, 34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 90].

**Second Pass:**
- Find the smallest element in the unsorted portion (34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 90), which is 12.
- Swap 12 with the second element (34).
- List becomes: [11, 12, 25, 34, 22, 64, 90].

**Third Pass:**
- Continue the process, finding the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion and swapping it with the appropriate position in the sorted portion.

**Repeat:**
- Repeat the process until the entire list is sorted.

Once the process is complete, the end result will be  `myList = [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`.

## Playing Cards Example ‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This example shows an unsorted list with the marker in its initial position pointing to the first item in the list.

The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest item to the right of the marker ‚Äì in this case 4 ‚Äì and then swapping this item with the item at the marker. 
The marker is then advanced to the next position as illustrated.

In the next pass the smallest item _(to right of the marker, i.e.5)_ is swapped with the item pointed to by the marker _(i.e. 6)_. 
This leaves the list looking like this:

This process continues in a systematic fashion until all the items in the list have been processed.
6 has just been swapped with 10. The next swap will be 9 and 7.

9 has just been swapped with 7 and the marker is advanced to 8 ‚Äì since no item to the right of the marker is smaller than 8 the list will remain unchanged.

The list remains unchanged and the marker is advanced to 10.

9 is swapped with 10 and the list is **sorted!**

## Worked Example 1 üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªüìù 
Type up the sample code below into Thonny and see if you can figure out what's going on.

````python
# Simple (Selection) Sort

# Initialaise Unsorted list
myList = [9, 6, 10, 4, 8, 5, 7]

# Initialise marker
marker = 0

# Traverse List
while marker < len(myList):
    # Find minimum item to right of marker
    index_of_min = marker
    for j in range (marker + 1, len(myList)):
        if myList[index_of_min] > myList[j]:
            index_of_min = j
    # Check to see new order of our list
    print(myList, "marker at index", marker)
    
    # Swap smallest item with item at marker
    temp = myList[marker]                   # save item at marker
    myList[marker] = myList[index_of_min]   # copy 1
    myList[index_of_min] = temp             # copy 2
    
    # Advance marker to the right by 1 position
    marker = marker + 1

print("Finished List: ", myList)
````
### Let's think about this ü§î 

- The values to be sorted are stored in a list called `myList`.
- The variable ``marker`` is used to store the index that will contain the next item to be sorted.
- _(All items to the left of marker are sorted and all items to the right of marker are yet to be processed.)_
- The variable ``index_of_min`` is the index of the **smallest item to the right of the marker.**
- _(The item at this position will be swapped with the item at the marker ‚Äì this is the heart of the algorithm.)_

The illustration below depicts the changing values of ``marker`` and ``index_of_min`` as the algorithm sorts a list of **7 items** in 

`myList = [9, 6, 10, 4, 8, 5, 7]`.

## Worked Example 2 üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªüìù 
Type up this next example into Thonny and see if you can figure out what's going on.


````python
# Example 2


numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

### Various Test Lists
# numbers = [10,9,8,4,6,5,7]
# numbers = [9, 6, 10, 4, 8, 5, 7]		'''This one confuses me a little'''


# Simple Sort algorithm 
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[j] < numbers[i]:
            # swap the values of our two variables
            numbers[i], numbers[j] = numbers[j], numbers[i]
            
    # Check to see new order of our list after each full traverse
    print(numbers, "marker at index [",i, "]")
    
# Printing the sorted array
print("Sorted array:", numbers)


````

### Let's think about this ü§î 

- We directly swap the values of ``numbers[i]`` and ``numbers[j]`` when needed.
- We simplify the condition in the ``if`` statement to directly compare ``numbers[j]`` with ``numbers[i]``.
- This version achieves the same sorting result while reducing the number of variables used and simplifying the code structure.
- Finally, try to **predict** the list order using the ``### Various Test Lists`` in the code above.
